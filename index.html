	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> Howdy! </h2>
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px"> I am Galen Tran.  I'm a senior at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science and Minoring in Mathematics.
	<br> If you're wondering about the uniform on this page and the home page, it's because I am in the Corps of Cadets, which
	<br> is a four-year leadership program that prepares cadets to be leaders in the military or the corperate world.
	<br> I joined the Corps because I was curious to see if this lifestyle was meant for me. This curiosity has led me to 
	<br> gain valuable friends, become a better leader, endure hardships, and love the university's rich history and traditions.
	<br> If you would like to more about the Corps, you can go to <a href = "https://corps.tamu.edu/"> corps.tamu.edu. </a> </p>
	
	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> Breaking the Ice </h2>
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px">
	Of course, there's more to me than being a cadet. My favorite things include car racing, sci-fi movies and TV shows, and driving. 
	<br> The best race I ever attended was the Indy 500 in 2016, where I got to see 33 drivers pass each other over 200 mph
	<br> for 3 hours until  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7BZrwSLSZE"> Alexander Rossi </a> won on fuel strategy. If you ask me what I want to watch, I'll gladly say I'd watch 
	<br> a Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, or MCU movie marathon. And why do think I like driving? I believe it's fun because I can control
	<br> my own pace based on my mood, whether I want to take things slow and cruise or go all out and pretend I'm a racing driver.
	</p>

	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> My Mission </h2>
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px">
	My goal in the field of computer science is to create new technology that will improve the future. My motivation in this field
	<br> comes from my passion of serving others and interest in seeing how the software I helped code can benefit society. </p>
	
	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> My Studies </h2>
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px">
	At school, I contribute to computer science by going to classes that will build my knowledge on coding techniques and teamwork. 
	<br> Utilizing languages such as Java, C++, and Scheme, I developed my technical skills in challenging courses such as Data
	<br> Structures and Algorithms, Intro to Computing Systems, and Programming Languages. Additionally, the lessons I learned from 
	<br> the Corps can help me with my studies as well by communicating clearly, planning effectively, and working under pressure. 
	<br> Though I haven't joined an organization at school that will allow me to apply what I've learned yet, I will use my 
	<br> combined skills from both worlds to create the best products for those looking for optimal solutions.

	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> My Contribution </h2>
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px">
	My biggest contribution comes from an internship I had with Lockheed Martin last summer as a Software Engineer. Here,
	<br> I was placed in a team of nine experienced employees who helped me learn more about the company and life in the workforce. 
	<br> During this time, I helped the company by cooperating with my teammates in optimizing aircraft software through writing 
	<br> new features and updating older code. As a result, I gained experience in debugging, utilizing functions with fewer run times, 
	<br> and testing code to ensure the product works before releasing it. I even gained non-technical skills through teamwork, 
	<br> <a href = "https://monday.com/blog/agile-planning/"> Agile</a> planning, and networking with workers outside of my team. The biggest lessons I learned is to have fun at work,
	<br> take initiative to learn new skills, and pay close attention to what I'm working on. These lessons are important to me
	<br> because I get to know my teammates better and build each other's trust through fun, I learn from first hand experience on how 
	<br> to get tasks done by taking initiative, and think about the importance of having a trustworthy product for our customers, 
	<br> in this case our Armed Forces, to use in the field through attention to detail.

	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> Big Event </h2>
	
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px">
	Ever since freshman year, I've participated in Big Event, which is the largest student-run service project at Texas A&M.
	<br> The purpose of Big Event is to help residents in the Bryan/College Station area in various home improvement projects.
	<br> So far, I've participated Big Event three times with other cadets, all with different projects:
	<br> Freshman Year: cleaned toys and cleared a backyard for a child daycare home.
	<br> Sophomore Year: planted mulch on trees in the frontyard and backyard for an elderly resident.
	<br> Junior Year: site leader for a project that involved planting trees, cutting old tree roots, and cleaning an attic for a family.

	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> Toys for Tots </h2>
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px">
	Toys for Tots is a United States Marine Corps Reserve program that donates toys to families who can't afford toys for 
	<br> their children. In my freshman and sophomore year, my Corps outfit had the opportunity to help Toys for Tots by 
	<br> standing outside Kyle Field before Midnight Yell and ask atendees if they would like to donate money. The majority
	<br> of the donations would go to the organization, while the rest would go into my outfit's funds.

	<h2 align = "center-left"; style = "font-size:28px; font-family:garamond;"> Scotty's House </h2>
	<p style = "font-family:garamond; font-size:17px">
	Scotty's House is a non-profit Child Advocacy Center that helps children suffering from child abuse and/or neglect through
	<br> assessment, counseling, and education. Last semester, as a Major Unit Public Relations/Recruiting Officer in charge of five 
	<br> PR/Recruiting chains in five outfits in the Corps, I scheduled a volunteer project with this group that involved creating 
	<br> an outside walking trail for child therapy sessions. I was able to get about twenty cadets to sign up for this project. 
	<br> Additionally, my Major Unit directly donates money to Scotty's House to help them with their operations and for the cadets
	<br> in the Class of 2021 in my five outfits to compete on which outfit gets to raise the most money to be Officers of the Day
	<br> for an Aggie football game for the 2020 season.
